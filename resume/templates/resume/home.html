        <h5>Relational Databases</h5>
        <p>
            I'm confident in my ability to create databases that include one to one, one to many,
            and many to many relationship types. This can be done in SQL as well as using python ORMs such as SQLAlchemy.
            <a href="https://github.com/Bailey-Alger/Relational-Database" target="_blank">Here</a>
            you can find a project I completed where I made a small database that includes the three relationships.
            The database uses information for animated shows as its base. The relationships are:
            show to main character - OTO; studio to shows - OTM; and shows to genres - MTM;

        <h5>Efficiency</h5>
        <p>I find it interesting when people are able to create incedibly efficient code. For example, Doom 1993 was revolutionary at the time it was released because the programmers, primarily John Carmack, utilized binary space partitioning. Even something as simple as using checkerboard rendering to increase video game resolution while utilizing the same processing power is amazing.</p>

        <h5>Always Learning</h5>
        <p>Software development is an ever evolving industry. Languages, frameworks, and tools constantly get updated. New tech is always being developed. With a career in software there's always something new to learn and adapt to. It's nice to know that even if I'm working the exact same job for 20 years the day-to-day work will change.</p>

        <h5>Building</h5>
        <p>Nearly everyone roughly around my age played with legos growing up. I personally loved legos. Any time I got my hands on a new set you could garentee i'd have it built within the next 2 days no matter how big it was. My dad is also a general contractor and has been my whole life so maybe building new things just runs in the genes.</p>
